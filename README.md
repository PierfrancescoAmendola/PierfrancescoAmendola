## 🌍 Languages

I am deeply motivated to learn and speak multiple languages because I see languages as powerful tools for connection, cultural understanding, and personal growth. Each new language allows me to engage with different perspectives, traditions, and ways of thinking, fostering openness and adaptability. I enjoy the intellectual challenge of language learning and appreciate the ability to communicate across cultural boundaries. This passion drives me to continually improve my existing language skills and actively pursue learning new languages. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to speak with native speakers and improve my knowledge of English and Spanish. I learned pronunciation and, in addition to the right way to pronounce and write it, I learned common language, the true life words of those languages. I improved and consolidated my English studies in London for a couple of months. Instead, as far as Spanish is concerned, I had the opportunity to communicate for most of my childhood and adolescence with a Venezuelan family, very close to my family, and in doing so I took on Latin pronunciation and learned everything there was to know about Venezuela and its traditions. Even thought I was born, here in Italy, and I grew up here, I feel that my soul is a little Latin too

* **Italian:** Native
* **English:** Native-level (UK certification), B2 in Italy
* **Spanish:** Fluent
* **French:** studied at middle school, I understand it but a little difficult to speak it
* **German:** I can speak basic German
* **Portoguese:** I'm learning
